### Build AI-powered experiences

We started Firebase back in 2012 with a single product: a NoSQL database that you could access directly from your web and mobile apps. And while we still love NoSQL databases–such as our own Firestore and Realtime Database–for the scalability they offer, sometimes you have a use-case that just screams for a relational data model. And over the past few years we’ve seen a healthy ecosystem of SQL-based backend services spring up. Listening to your feedback, we’re excited to bring PostgreSQL to Firebase with a brand new product called Firebase Data Connect in private preview.
